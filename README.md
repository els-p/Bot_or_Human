# Bot_or_Human
Classifying posts from Reddit - Posted by Bot or Human?

## Problem Statement
Social media posts content can be created by computer bots. How can we cut out the noise to find posts truly generated by humans?

## Goal
To build a binary classifer model that can identify the top relevant words from two subreddits:
1. [r/SubredditSimulator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator/) 
2. [r/Showerthoughts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/) 

The model should be able to classify posts into one created by Bots or Humans.
